        Liverpool City Region is a combined authority area in North West England.
        It has six council areas; five Merseyside metropolitan boroughs
        (Liverpool, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral) and the Cheshire unitary
        authority of Halton.[3] The region had a population of 1,571,045 in
        2022.[4] The region's mayor and combined authority (LCRCA) have a
        devolution deal responsible for economic development, regeneration,
        transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing, spatial
        planning and physical infrastructure.[5][6][7] The region's economic
        development was supported by the Liverpool City Region Local Enterprise
        Partnership (LEP), established in 2010 as the private sector-led board
        comprising political and business leaders from around the city region.[8]
        The LEP's functions were merged into the combined authority in 2023.[9]
