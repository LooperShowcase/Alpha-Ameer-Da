 <p>Liverpool: Michael Edwards return set to be confirmed with ex-Bournemouth man Richard Hughes also set to join
Liverpool are set to confirm the return of Michael Edwards next week in a role which would see him lead football operations; Richard Hughes set to join as sporting director; watch Liverpool vs Man City on Sunday, live on Sky Sports Main Event and Premier League from 3pm; kick-off 3.45pm Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid made checks on Edwards' interest in taking over sporting director duties, but it was clear he would not be operating in that capacity moving forward.
<p>FSG owner John W Henry and president Mike Gordon were acutely aware of that and had proposed a wider-ranging position. After initially being knocked back, they were able to make a more compelling pitch in the US, incorporating more than just Liverpool.
Liverpool FC has proudly unveiled a specially commissioned bronze plaque at Anfield that pays homage to the influential members of The Boot Room Boys – the creators and custodians of the club’s fabled inner sanctum, birthplace of ‘The Liverpool Way.’</p>

The new tribute, situated on 97 Avenue, depicts the eight original members of The Boot Room – Geoff Twentyman, Ronnie Moran, Roy Evans, Bob Paisley, Reuben Bennett, Joe Fagan, John Bennison and Tom Saunders.

The families of The Boot Room Boys were joined by Reds legends and representatives from the club and partner Kodansha at a special unveiling event at Anfield this week. Evans, the only living member of The Boot Room Boys, helped to unveil the new plaque alongside former LFC captain Phil Thompson.

“It’s such an honour to be recognised in this way alongside some of the club’s greats,” said Evans. “To be able to look back and reflect on the memories we experienced together and share them with their friends and families has been a real privilege.”

<p>Liverpool welcome Mohamed Salah back for tonight’s Europa League tie with Sparta Prague.

On Wednesday, the Egyptian winger appeared during the Reds’ open training session before it was confirmed that he will feature in the squad. He has been named on the bench in Prague.

“Mo travelled,” Jurgen Klopp said in his pre-match press conference. “He is with us, he trained two days, so full of energy. We have to see [how much he will play].

“But it is so good that he is back, that is really good for us and you can see in his face he is very happy. A very unlucky situation with being that long out and in for a moment, if you want, at Brentford, played an incredible game there and was out again. That’s how it is.

“We want to be careful, we have to be careful, but in the middle of a super-intense period of the season we need everybody and now let’s see how long we can use him. That’s how it is with him and with others as well. Yeah, just good news.”

Virgil van Dijk is dropped to the bench, with one eye on Sunday’s huge Premier League showdown with Manchester City, while Dominik Szoboszlai is also among the substitutes.

It is still a pretty strong lineup from the Reds, with Darwin Nunez leading the line, Wataru Endo at the base of midfield and Andy Robertson starting at left-back.

Liverpool XI: Kelleher, Gomez, Konate, Quansah, Robertson, Endo, Mac Allister, Elliott, Diaz, Gakpo, Nunez

Subs: Adrian, Mrozek, Van Dijk, Szoboszlai, Salah, Tsimikas, Clark, Gordon, McConnell, Koumas, Bradley, Musialowski

Time and date: 5.45pm GMT, Thursday March 7, 2024
